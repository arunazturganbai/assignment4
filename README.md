The provided code consists of two classes: `HashNode` and `MyHashTable`. Let's go through each class and explain their functionality:

1. `HashNode` class:
   - This class represents a node that holds a key-value pair for a hash table. It has three instance variables: `key`, `value`, and `next`.
   - The `key` variable represents the key associated with the node, and the `value` variable represents the corresponding value.
   - The `next` variable is a reference to the next node in case of collisions. If multiple nodes with different keys hash to the same index in the hash table, they are stored as a linked list using the `next` reference.
   - The class has a constructor that takes a key and a value to initialize the node. It also overrides the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the node.

2. `MyHashTable` class:
   - This class represents a hash table data structure. It is a generic class that takes two type parameters `K` and `V`, representing the key and value types, respectively.
   - The class includes a nested static class `HashNode`, which is the same as the `HashNode` class described above. This nested class is specific to the `MyHashTable` class.
   - The `MyHashTable` class contains the following instance variables:
     - `chainArray`: An array of `HashNode` elements. Each element represents the head of a linked list of nodes that have hashed to the same index.
     - `M`: The size of the hash table or the number of buckets.
     - `size`: The number of key-value pairs stored in the hash table.
   - The class has two constructors:
     - The default constructor creates a hash table with a default size of 11, initializing the `chainArray` accordingly.
     - The parameterized constructor allows specifying a custom size for the hash table and initializes the `chainArray` with that size.
   - The `hash()` method takes a key as input and returns the hash value computed using the key's `hashCode()` method. It performs modulo division with `M` to ensure the hash value falls within the valid range.
   - The `put()` method inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. It computes the hash value for the key, retrieves the corresponding linked list, and traverses it to check if the key already exists. If so, it updates the corresponding value. If not, it creates a new `HashNode` and adds it to the beginning of the linked list. The `size` is incremented accordingly.
   - The `get()` method retrieves the value associated with a given key from the hash table. It computes the hash value for the key, retrieves the linked list, and searches for the node with the matching key. If found, it returns the corresponding value. If not found, it returns `null`.
   - The `remove()` method removes a key-value pair with a given key from the hash table. It computes the hash value for the key, retrieves the linked list, and searches for the node with the matching key. If found, it removes the node from the linked list, adjusts the references accordingly, and decrements the `size`. It returns the value of the removed node. If not found, it returns `null`.
   - The `contains()` method checks if a given value exists in the hash table. It iterates over each linked list in the `chainArray` and searches for a node with the matching value. If found, it returns `true`. If not found, it returns `false`.
   - The `getKey()` method retrieves the key associated with a given value from the hash table. It iterates over

 each linked list in the `chainArray` and searches for a node with the matching value. If found, it returns the key of that node. If not found, it returns `null`.

Overall, the `MyHashTable` class provides an implementation of a hash table using separate chaining to handle collisions. It allows inserting, retrieving, removing, and checking the existence of key-value pairs based on the keys and values provided.
